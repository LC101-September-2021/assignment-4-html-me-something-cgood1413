               <p id="about-text">When planning for children, my mother initially wanted an eldest son 
                  and a younger daughter. After having my eldest sister for her first child, 
                  she decided that she would be content with the inverse: a younger son 
                  and eldest daughter. This led to the birth of my second oldest sister.
                  Realizing that her original plan wasn’t meant to be, my mother decided that 
                  she simply just wanted <strong>a</strong> son and so had my third sister. 
                  Finally, she told herself that she would try just once more for a boy and 
                  regardless of the outcome it would be her last child. The universe then 
                  decided to stop playing its cosmic joke with my mother, who had her one 
                  and only boy that she wanted; her last <em>Chance</em> for a son.</p>

                  virtually no recollection of living there, being born in California has 
                  always been a primary part of my history. This is especially true since I 
                  use my passport as my primary identification and it shows the state of birth.</p>

                  Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville (the better SIU). This is the 
                  place where I really formed my identity and interests, so to me it holds a 
                  lot of sentimental value.</p>

                  While the cultures between the United States and France aren’t vastly different, 
                  it was definitely a lesson in being independent yet receptive.</p>

                  pursuits which is how I ended up at LaunchCode&trade;!</p>

               <p>This assignment as well as external materials have shown me how useful CSS 
                  can be when it comes to front-end design. While I feel like this is a decent 
                  first attempt, I know I need more experience with it.</p>

               <p>Beyond the scope of this class, I think tackling Python would be a natural 
                  progression in my education. It’s the language that use primarily used in 
                  NLP fields, and it’d be nice to marry my past experience with my new education.</p>
